#
# A script to run a series of build commands in sequence.
# It accepts an optional BASE_IMAGE argument, pulls it, inspects it,
# and then passes it to each command.
# If no argument is provided, a default value is used.
# It checks the return code of each command and exits immediately
# if a command fails, printing an error message.
#

# --- Configuration ---
# Set 'e' option to exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# This provides a safety net, although the script also has explicit checks.
set -e

# --- Commands Definitions ---
# Define the commands to be run in arrays for easy looping.
# Note: Each command is a single string within the array.

# The :- syntax is a standard shell parameter expansion.
